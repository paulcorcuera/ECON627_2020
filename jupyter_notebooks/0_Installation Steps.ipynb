    "## Installation Steps \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly advice to install Anaconda to be able to use Jupyter Notebooks (standard installation comes with Python). You can download it from this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and choosing the one that works in your operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Julia \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download Julia from the [official site](https://julialang.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Build Conda Environment for Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Julia app and a command prompt will open. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200707105720/Screenshot22.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to install the `IJulia` package. To do so, you can type the following lines and press Enter: \n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "    using Pkg\n",
    "    Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait until Julia installs the package. After it's done the connection between Anaconda and Julia has been established.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Start Working on your Stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that you have an app named Anaconda Prompt. Open such application and a command prompt will open. If it's possible run this application as administrator.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Change directory to the desired workspace \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to type \n",
    "```\n",
    "    cd desired_folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Type \n",
    "```\n",
    "    jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be patient, and a webpage that looks like this will pop-up \n",
    "\n",
    "![img2](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781788998369/graphics/609de416-fc00-4144-b23a-cdf26d45a85e.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on the Julia icon you will open a new jupyter notebook that renders Julia code. Otherwise, you can click on `File` and create a new notebook from there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Jupyter Notebooks \n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course save your Jupyter notebooks that have the `.ipynb` extension if you click `Save as...`. You can also move jupyter notebooks to your folder and open them (for example, this sample file). I strongly advice to click on `File` and then `Export Notebook as HTML` and send your problem sets under this format. To export as PDF you require to do some extra steps that I will omit in this explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another Option \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working from another computer and don't want to go through all the installation steps, you can use VSE's syzygy webpage. If you sign-in with your UBC credentials at  https://vse.syzygy.ca/ you are able to open the same Jupyter Lab webpage. The only drawback of this is that they still work with the (old) 1.2 Julia version. \n"
